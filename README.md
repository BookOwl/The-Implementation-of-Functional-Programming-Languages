# The-Implementation-of-Functional-Programming-Languages
Simon Peyton Jones's classic book on FP compilers.

I'm only putting the PDF up here because the [Microsoft page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-implementation-of-functional-programming-languages/) that has the offical download links to a 404. So please don't sue me for copyright infringement!
